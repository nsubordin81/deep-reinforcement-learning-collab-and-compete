# deep-reinforcement-learning-p2-double-jointed-arms
Exploration of policy gradient and actor critic methods with a specific task from the Unity ML Agents environment involving keeping simulated arms on a target.

- [ ] This file has instructions for getting the necessary dependencies and downloading files needed to train and use the agent
- [ ] This file has a description for how to run the agent
- [ ] I've got a Report.md outlining the implementation, including the learning algorithm used, the hyperparameters chosen, and the model architectures for ANNs
- [ ] There is a plot of the rewards in the Report.md file showing either successfully meeting version 1 or 2 of the task
- [ ] The Report.md file has the number of episodes required to solve the environment as well
